# RockPaperScissors

This is a Rock-Paper-Scissors game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The player competes against the computer by selecting one of the three optionsâ€”rock, paper, or scissors. The computer randomly selects its move, and the game displays the result of each round, updates the score, and shows both the player's and the computer's moves.

It also includes a Restart button to reset scores and start a new game.
